CloakPost
Secure social platform for CSE447 Cryptography Lab, implementing encrypted posts, messaging, and social features.
Features

Authentication: Register, login, logout with PBKDF2-derived session keys.
Posts: Create, edit, delete, search, filter, paginate with Fernet encryption and visibility controls (Global/Friends Only).
Messaging: RSA-encrypted messages.
Friend Requests: Secure relationship management with notifications.
Profiles: View user info, friends, and link to posts.
UI: Responsive, styled with Bootstrap 5.3 and Font Awesome.

Setup

Clone the repository:git clone https://github.com/your-username/CloakPost.git
cd CloakPost


Create a virtual environment:python -m venv env
source env/bin/activate  # Windows: env\Scripts\activate


Install dependencies:pip install -r requirements.txt


Create a .env file based on .env.example:cp .env.example .env

Edit .env with secure values for SECRET_KEY and DATA_ENCRYPTION_KEY.
Run migrations:python manage.py migrate


Start the server:python manage.py runserver


Access at http://localhost:8000.

Security Measures

.env is ignored by .gitignore to protect secrets.
Post content is encrypted with Fernet.
Messages use RSA encryption.
Passwords are hashed with Djangoâ€™s PBKDF2.
Private repository recommended for submission.

Lab Checkpoints (CSE447)

Login/Register: Implemented at /users/login/ and /users/register/.
Encrypt User Info: RSA keys stored; private key encryption planned.
Hash/Salt Password: Django PBKDF2 and custom PBKDF2HMAC.
Credential Check: Separate login_view.
Key Management: Fernet, RSA, and session keys.
Post/View Encryption: Fernet for posts.
Encrypt Database: Post content and messages encrypted; private key encryption needed.
MAC (Optional): Not implemented but planned.

Future Improvements

Encrypt CustomUser.encrypted_private_key.
Implement key rotation.
Add HMAC for integrity.
